Hi! I'm Veilza, a catgirl who likes to work on things that people might find fun or useful. I mostly make things for FoundryVTT, but I have a long history of developing websites and I'm starting to make video games, too!

### Current projects
My current big projects that I'm super proud of are:
* Dekatreis: A homebrew tabletop setting for Pathfinder 2 system.
* CofD Utilities: A module for the Chronicles of Darkness system that adds a group beats manager and a scene tracker for the storyteller.
* World of Darkness 5e: A FoundryVTT system for the 5th edition gamelines of World of Darkness.

### Knowledgebase
I mostly use a mixture of basic frontend knowledge and Javascript to make the above repositories, but I'm also proficient in:
* Python (and the Django framework)
* Ruby (and the Ruby on Rails framework)
* C#
* C++
* PHP
* MySQL
* MongoDB
* GDScript

If you like anything I do, I'd really appreciate if you'd [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/veilza)! I'll always keep on working on things, though, so it's never necessary.
